# Presentation

First of all, I would like to say that this challenge made me a lot happier because I could use it as an opportunity to learn new things, improve others and practice coding.

Thank you all for this nourishing opportunity.

# Decisions

My first approach was based on researching existing examples to better understand the challenge. I found this website: https://pokeapi.webflow.io/ which gave me an idea of how to start.

After that, I looked inside the poke API docs to understand the structure of the request and the available endpoints.

Then I started mentally wireframing the structure of the challenge, such as header, search bar, card, pagination, and footer, based on the website that I found earlier and other pokemon styled websites.

I've started writing the header, input, the custom hooks, took a coffee, and the context. I was able to finally fetch data and show it in the front.

Instanced the pagination after that, refactored a lot of the code overall, and then started to research Unit Testing, because I'm currently studying it. I even wrote a simple test, for the Footer component, but I understand that I need to invest more effort in learning Unit Testing.

In this project I start it fetching data, setting it in the context, and then showing it in the front. Then the user can do two actions, which are using the input to search a pokemon by ID or exact name or using the pagination at the bottom to loop through other Pokemon.

# Conclusion

Independent of the feedback, I just have to say that I enjoyed going through this challenge, I drank lots of coffee which gave me sleeplessness but in the end, it was worth it :)

Thank you all,
